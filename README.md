**Note**: this fork previously contained code for the [Vim-roam](https://github.com/samgriesemer/vim-roam)
project, but has since been moved to its own repo (as linked). _This repo_ will now be used as the primary
`wiki.vim` development fork that Vim-roam depends on. 

# Introduction

This is a [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) plugin for writing and maintaining
a personal wiki. The plugin was initially based on
[vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), but it is written mostly from
scratch and is based on a more "do one thing and do it well" philosophy.

Note: `wiki.vim` is _not_ a filetype plugin. It is designed so that it may be used
      along with filetype plugins, e.g. for dedicated Markdown plugins. One may
      also use [wiki-ft.vim](https://github.com/lervag/wiki-ft.vim) for simple
      syntax highlighting and folding of `.wiki` files, if desired.

This README file contains basic information on how to get started, as well as
a list of available features. For more details, please confer the
[full documentation](doc/wiki.txt).

# Quick Start

## Installation

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), then add the
following line to your `vimrc` file:

```vim
Plug 'lervag/wiki.vim'
```

Or use some other plugin manager:
* [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
* [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
* [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

## Usage

This outlines the basic steps to get started:

1. Create a wiki directory where the wiki files should be stored, for instance
   `~/wiki`.

2. Add the following to your `vimrc` file:

   ```vim
   let g:wiki_root = '~/wiki'
   ```

3. Now you can open the index file (by default `index.wiki`) with `<leader>ww`
   and start to add your notes as desired.

# Acknowledgements

Without [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), this plugin would never
have existed. So my thanks go to the smart people that developed and maintains
`vimwiki`, both for the inspiration and for the ideas.
